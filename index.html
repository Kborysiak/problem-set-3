         Computers and computing devices have become very familiar to us over
          the past few years, for some of us it may be impossible to spend a day
          without using technology. These devices that we use everyday may look very
          different than their counter parts (ie. a Laptop and a Desktop) but
          despite their looks they all share the basic hardware that goes into
         a computer.

      <img src="images/DesktopComputer.jpg" align=left> All computers have some sort of keyboard for user inputs
      aswell as a mouse and some sort of screen. These are some of the basics
      that we use to control a computer, but as seen in the image a dekstop computer
      is way bigger than a laptop, however, the hardware inside is basically the same
      and serves the same purpose.<br>
