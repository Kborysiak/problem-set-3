    <h1>Computers & Their Hardware Makeup</h1>
    <hr>

      <p>
         Computers and computing devices have become very familiar to us over
          the past few years, for some of us it may be impossible to spend a day
          without using technology. These devices that we use everyday may look very
          different than their counter parts (ie. a Laptop and a Desktop) but
          despite their looks they all share the basic hardware that goes into
         a computer.

      <p> All computers have some sort of keyboard for user inputs
      aswell as a mouse and some sort of screen. These are some of the basics
      that we use to control a computer, but as seen in the image a dekstop computer
      is way bigger than a laptop, however, the hardware inside is basically the same
      and serves the same purpose. <br>
      <h3>The basic common hardware can be seen in the list below.</h3>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Central Processing Unit</li>
      <li>Graphical Procesing unit</li>
      <li>Mother Board</li>
      <li>Random Access Memory</li>
      <li>Hard Drive / Solid State Drive </li>
      <li>Power Supply Unit</li>
      <li>Cooling Equipment/Case</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Video & Data Processing</h2>

          <p>
            Computers recieve and push data from servers and other computers, but for this data to be understood Computers
            need to have the utilities to do so. This is where components such as the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU
            (Graphical Processing Unit) come into play. These components play a vital role in data processing and visual outputs.
            A CPU is present in all computers, but some computers may not have a GPU as they may have an APU which is a combination
            of both. The motherboard houses these two components and basically sends data through chips to these components, and is
            basically responsible for coordinating things that are happening in your computer.
          </p>

      <h2>Memory Processing & Storage</h2>

          <p>
            The data that the CPU and GPU process must be stored somewhere. This is where long term storage and
            short term storage come into play. There are two components that come into play here, RAM (Random Access
            Memory) and Hard drives/solid state drives. RAM stores data in a short term manner that can be used by the Computer
            in process comming, whilst the Hard drive stores data that will remain even after the computer is turned off.
          </p>

        <h2>Powering & Cooling a Computer</h2>
          <p>
            Computer components such as the CPU and GPU produce a lot of heat when under streneuous use. This causes the components to heat up, but to safely operate
            a computer with these heated components; fans are used to cool down these components and eject the produced heat out the back of the computer. Computers also
            require power which is supplied by a PSU (Power Supply Unit). The PSU converts power from the outlet into power that is usable by the computer, allowing for the
            power to be sent around the computer through internal wires.
